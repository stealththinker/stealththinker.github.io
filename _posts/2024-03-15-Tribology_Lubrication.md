Interfacing surfaces in relative motions, including friction, wear and erosion

**Lubrication Engineer**

### Friction

Resisting force between surfaces with relative movement

- Energy loss
- Increased power consumption
- Temperature Increase
- Noise increase
- **Wear of component with dimensional change**

**Types**

- Static
- Kinetic
- Rolling

### Wear

Material loss out of body as consequence of tribological stress

- **Abrasive wear**: Surface peaks of harder body making scratches in softer body
    - 2 body abrasion: Micro cutting of body with hard roughness peaks of opposing body
    - 3 Body Abrasion: Micro cutting of both bodies with hard particles within intermediate layer
    - Abrasive wear Leads to material losses in form of **troughs** which affects **Lubrication film & Contaminates the lube oil.**
- **Adhesive wear ?**
    - Results in Seizure
    - Caused by Poor lubrication or Insufficient oil film
    - Characterized by local micro-welding points between peaks of both surfaces, with damage following separation.

### Wear & Wear Mechanisms

- Corrosive: Chemical reaction with surrounding environment.
- Pitting: Surface cavitation caused by rolling contact
- Cavitation: Formation and collapse of bubbles on surface due to rapid pressure changes

### Function of Lubricant

- Friction Control → Separates moving surfaces
- Wear Control → Reduces abrasive wear
- Corrosion Control → Protects Surfaces from Corrosive substances
- Temperature Control → Absorbs and Transfer Heat
- Contamination Control → Transports Particles and other contaminants of Filters\Separators
- Power Tran-mission → Transmits force and Motion

### Lubrication Regimes

- **Hydrodynamic**: Full film lubrication or Surface Separation
    - Pressure generated by Sliding velocity of layers
    - Adequate oil supply
    - Oil Viscosity
    - Found in *Journal Bearings.*
- Thin Film or Mixed
    - Film thickness ~ Surface Asperities
- Elasto-Hydrodynamic
    - Found in Gears, anti-friction bearings, cams
    - Elastic Deformation of surfaces
    - Large increase in Pressure viscosity
- Boundary
    - Film thickness < Surface Asperities

### Lubrication in Bearings Stages

**Startup** (No oil Pressure), **Boundary Lubrication**

**Intermediate**: Low Oil pressure (**Mixed Lubrication**)

**Running**: Full oil pressure (**Hydrodynamic Lubrication**)

### Structure of Lubricating oil

**Base stock** (Mineral\Synthetic\Vegetable) Provides

- Viscosity for controlling friction and wear
- Corrosion and Oxidation resistance
- Heat transfer
- Contamination suspension
- Additive suspension

**Additives** (Organic & Inorganic)

- Enhances existing Base stock properties
- Surpasses *undesirable* base stock props
- New properties

### Base Oil Technologies

Mineral oils and Hydrocarbons

- Paraffins
- Branched paraffins
- Naphthene
- Aromatics

Chain Length : C25- C40

Refining Process

- Solvent Refining
- Hydro Cracking

### API Base stock Categories

Viscosity index increases as group increases

- Group 1 - Solvent Refined Mineral oils
- Group 2 - Hydro Processed mineral oil
- Group 2+ - Hydro Cracked mineral oils
- Group 3 - Severe Hydrocracked Synthetic oils
- Group 4 - Poly-alpha olefins (PAO’s)
- Group 5 - Other Synthetics

### Properties to keep in mind

- Viscosity
- Moisture
- TBN Total Base num : Measure of ability to neutralize acid
- TAN Total Acid Number: measure of acidity
- Flash point, Pour point (lowest point at which oil is observed to flow)
- Thermal operating range
- Fire resistance
- Oxidation stability
- Lubricity
- Shear stability
- Detergency
- Seal compatibility
- Contaminant sensitivity
- INFRA Red analysis (Water, Oxidation, Nitration)
- Foam test
- Particle Counting
- Water Metals

### Components of Grease

- Base Oil \ Mineral Oil \ Synthetic Oil
- Thickeners \ Soaps
- Additives \ Solid Lubricants \ Corrosion Inhibitors \ Adhesion Improvers

Properties

### Role of Additives

- Extreme Pressure
    - Mitigate effects of high load boundary lubrication
    - Reacts with surface under heat to form ductile films
    - Sulphur-phosphorous compounds, graphite, Borate or MoS2
- Anti Wear
    - Reduce wear and friction from sliding contact
    - Surface active materials form low shear strength between sliding surfaces
    - ZDDP, TCP
- Corrosion Inhibitors
    - Reduce rust formation on iron surface
    - Additive is metal -phillic and hydrophobic
    - Long chain fatty acids, Naphthalene sulphorates, Phosphoric acid derivatives
- Anti-Oxidants or Oxidation Inhibitors
    - Inhibit reaction with oxygen
    - Additive oxidizes in preference to oil seeking out free radicals and peroxides
    - Hindered Phenols, Zinc di thiophosphates, Aromatic amines
- Foam Inhibitors
    - Prevents formation of foam and aerated oils
    - Weakness bubbles allows them to break rapidly
    - Organic polymers, Methyl silicone
- Viscosity Index Improvers
    - Additive expands at higher temperature, slowing down thinning rate of oil
    - Ethylene propylene copolymers, polymethacrylates
- Dispersants
- Detergents

### Lube Oil Properties

- Viscosity grading (ISO VG)  → cSt vs Temp
- Kinematic Viscosity
- Dynamic or Absolute Viscosity = KV * Density

### Viscosity Index

- Mineral oils ≥ 80
- Hydrotreated or Hydrocracked ≥ 95
- Poly-alpha-olefins ≥ 120
- Silicones ≥ 300

### Oxidation of Oils

Catalysts of oxidation

- Increased Viscosity, acids, oil darkening

Free radical mechanism via alkyl peroxy radicals
