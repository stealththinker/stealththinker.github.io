# Pressure Relief Devices

### Problems

- Overpressure due to process failure
- External Fire
- Flow from high pressure source
- Heat Input from Equipment
- Downstream Pumps or Compressor trip
- Ambient Heat transfer
- Liquid expansion in piping and surge
- Hammering in pipes

### Prevent measures

- Safer design (Low pressure process)
- Passive Control (Overdesign process equipment)
- Active Control (Install Relief systems)

### ASME Requirement

- All pressure vessels shall be protected by Pressure relieving device that shall prevent pressure from rising more than **10% OR 3 PSI** Whichever is greater above MAWP or Design Pressure.

### Pressure Terminology

**PRV Characteristics**

- Set Pressure
    - Change of Set Pressure is allowable in +- 5% only. Above which Spring redesign required.
- Overpressure
    - Allowable Overpressure : 110 % MAWP
- Blowdown
    - Difference between closing pressure and set pressure

**System Characteristics**

- MAWP
    - Design pressure
    - PRV Set Pressure or RD Burst Pressure
- Accumulation
    - Allowable accumulation : 110 % MAWP
- Design Pressure
- Operating Pressure

Back pressure

- Back Pressure
- Superimposed Back pressure
- Built up back pressure

LIFT

- Cold Differential Set Pressure (CDTP)
    - Pressure at which PRV Opens in test bench
    - Includes correction factors for service conditions of back pressure and temperature.
- Closing Pressure
    - Pressure at which disc establishes contact with seat

## Relief System Design Methodology

### Locate Reliefs

- All vessels
- Sections of Cool liquid lines exposed to heat
- Discharge sides of displacement pumps, compressors, turbines
- Vessel steam jackets

### Code

Relief Pressure should not exceed MAWP (Accumulation) 

- 3% fired and unfired steam boilers
- 10% vessels equipped with Single PRV
- 16% for Vessels with Multiple PRV
- 21% fire contingency

### Types of Relief Devices

- Pressure Safety Valve (PSV)
    - Actuated by static press
    - Rapid Opening (Pop action)
    - Compressible media (Gas, Vapor, Steam)
    - Refer **LIFT vs PRESSURE** Graph of PSV
- Pressure Relief Valve (PRV)
    - Static Pressure
    - Proportional opening with overpressure
    - Non Compressible Media (Liquids)
- Thermal Relief Valve (TRV)
    - Similar to PRV
    - Due to thermal expansions, pipelines blocked or isolation conditions
- Rupture Disc (RD)
    - Flat sheet + Disc holder
    - Designed based on Coeff. of Discharge Method (Valves are designed on this way?), Flow resistance method (Pressure drops due to entrance, exit sudden expansion)
    - Predetermined Weak point in Pressurized condition
    - Opens at burst pressure
    - Does not reclose
- Pilot Operated Relief Valve (PORV)
    - PRV with main valve is controlled by Auxiliary relief valve
    - Clean services and Operating pressure is near to set pressure
    - Area Top > Area seat so seal is tight.
    - Opening is Proportional to Differential Pressure
    - Low Pressure, Vacuum Protection
        - Series 90, Series 9000 POPRV
- Pressure and Vacuum Relief Valve (PVRV)
- Weight Loaded Breather Valve

Conventional PRV have no back pressure (equals to atm pressure) and vents directly to atm.

Back pressure increases set pressure

`Pv An = Fs + Pb An`

### Components of PSV

- Set pressure adjusting screw
- Spring: Spring Steel (Cadmium Plated)
- Bonnet
- Guides: Steel Cadmium Plated
- Trim SS316 or â€¦
    - Disc Holder
    - Seat Disc
    - Blowdown adjustment Ring
    - Bellows (in Balanced Piston RV)
- Body: Casting (CS)
- Gaskets: SW or Metallic
- Fasteners: High Tensile Material

### Installation Factors

- Inlet Pipe sizing
- Flow turbulence
- Pressure loss at inlet piping
- Vibration in inlet and outlet due to improper supports
- Slope for out pipe for free draining

## Inspection

- 1 Year after commissioning
- Frequency : 2-4 years based on condition
- Static and Mobile Pressure Vessels (SMPV) : LPG Bullets, Hydrogen Bullets once per year
- PSV, PVSV : Steam Drum inspected by IBR once in year
- Waste Heat Boilers once in 2 years

### Scope of Inspection

- Internals
- for Pilot valve: soft goods (O rings, Diaphragms)
- Tubing

### Repairs

- Lapping of seat disc
- Springs, guides, stem for corrosion & Bending
- Weld repair of Spring is not permitted.

### Causes of Improper Performance

- Corrosion: Incompatible metallurgy, change in service
- Damaged Seating Surfaces: Corrosion, Ingress of solid particles, chattering, erosion
- Failure of Springs: Weakening, Corrosion, crack, incorrect setting (overload)
- Failure of Bellows
- Improper Setting: Incorrect Test stand, PGs, Blowdown ring setting, test medium
- Fouling: corrosive inside valve
- **Chattering: Spring Relief devices require 25% min flow for seat to be in open condition else it will chatter and causes valve to frequently open and close.**
