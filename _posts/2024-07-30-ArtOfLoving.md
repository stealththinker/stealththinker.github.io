excerpt: Few words written with hope and resillience, in search of home.

In the morning light, Sun not so bright,  <br/>
I walk alone, no one in sight.<br/>
My heart is sad but still have courage to care.<br/>

Leaves moves softly, Sharing tree's secrets,<br/>
Holding insects in their lap, express they care.<br/>
Wind sing their mesmerising song, <br/>
Carries me as I walk along.<br/>

Rivers flow with stories to tell,<br/>
Their cool touch makes me feel well.<br/>
I dip my legs in waters, makes mind clear<br/>
Nature holds me near, Hugs like mother.  <br/>

Every step, a new start,<br/>
Fixing pieces of my heart.<br/>
Though love has left a lot scars,<br/>
I still hope for people, like a shining star.<br/>

In being alone, I start to grow,<br/>
Embracing high and low.<br/>
In leaves, wind chimes, and waters <br/>
I see love and dreams inside of me.<br/>

I walk alone, but not in pain,<br/>
Still have courage to love them. <br/>
In nature’s arms, I’m never alone,<br/>
In every breath, I find my home. <br/>
