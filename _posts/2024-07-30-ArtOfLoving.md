# Art of Loving alone

```
In the morning light, Sun not so bright,
I walk alone, no one in sight.
My heart is sad but still have courage to care.

Leaves moves softly, Sharing tree's secrets,
Holding insects in their lap, express they care.
Wind sing their mesmerising song, 
Carries me as I walk along.

Rivers flow with stories to tell,
Their cool touch makes me feel well.
I dip my legs in waters, makes mind clear
Nature holds me near, Hugs like mother.  

Every step, a new start,
Fixing pieces of my heart.
Though love has left a lot scars,
I still hope for people, like a shining star.

In being alone, I start to grow,
Embracing high and low.
In leaves, wind chimes, and waters 
I see love and dreams inside of me.

I walk alone, but not in pain,
Still have courage to love them. 
In nature’s arms, I’m never alone,
In every breath, I find my home.```
